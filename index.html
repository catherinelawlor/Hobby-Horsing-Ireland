    <p class="home"> A Brief History of Hobby Horsing.</p>

    <p > The earliest versions of hobby horses appeared in ancient Greece and Rome, where children used sticks to imitate riding. By the Middle Ages, hobby horses became part of festivals and theatrical performances across Europe. Over time, beautifully crafted wooden hobby horses emerged as cherished toys in the 18th and 19th centuries.
    Different cultures shaped the hobby horse in unique ways — from folk traditions in the UK to community celebrations in Finland. Each design carried its own story, decorated with ribbons, bells, or intricate carvings.
    Finland: The Modern Birthplace of the Sport
    While hobby horsing has existed for centuries, its transformation into a sport began in Finland around 2010. Finnish teens reinvented the stick horse, creating handcrafted models and organizing competitions without adult involvement. Their creativity sparked a nationwide movement that soon spread across Europe, the US, and Australia.
    Finland now hosts major events like the Finnish Hobby Horse Championships, attracting competitors from more than 15 countries. Influential figures such as Julia Mikkonen and social media creators like Nele Nöhrbaß have helped the sport flourish.
